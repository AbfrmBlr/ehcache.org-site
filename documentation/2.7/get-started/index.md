# Getting Started Overview

The following sections provide a documentation Table of Contents and additional information sources for getting started with Ehcache.

## "Getting Started" Table of Contents

| Topic | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
|[Hello, Ehcache](/documentation/2.7/get-started/introduction)|Introduction to caching with Ehcache and the benefits of caching.|
|[Cache Topologies](/documentation/2.7/get-started/cache-topologies)|This overview of the Ehcache caching topologies highlights the differences between distributed and replicated caching.|
|[Key Classes and Methods](/documentation/2.7/get-started/key-classes-methods)|Definitions of terms, key Ehcache classes, and cache usage patterns, as well as explanations of the CacheManager and the Ehcache interface.|
|[About Distributed Cache](/documentation/2.7/get-started/about-distributed-cache)|Distributed Ehcache combines an in-process Ehcache with the Terracotta Server Array acting as a backing cache store. This page details architecture and development for Distributed Ehcache running in a Terracotta cluster.|
|[Consistency Options](/documentation/2.7/get-started/consistency-options)|Explanation of the Distributed Ehcache consistency models in terms of standard distributed systems theory, plus use cases and recommended practices.|
|[Storage Options](/documentation/2.7/get-started/storage-options)|Description of the three storage options for Ehcache--MemoryStore, OffHeapStore, and DiskStore--plus suitable Element types, configuration examples, and performance considerations.|
|[Using Ehcache](/documentation/2.7/get-started/getting-started)|A quick guide to get you started with the packed Ehcache kit and using Ehcache with several popular platforms.|
|[Building From Source](/documentation/2.7/get-started/building)|Create your own Ehcache or distributed Ehcache build, rather than using the packed kit.|


## Getting Started in Theory and Practice
