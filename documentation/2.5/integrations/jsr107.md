# JSR107 (JCACHE) Support <a name="jsr107-support"/>

<a name="jsr107-implementation"/>
JSR107 is being currently being drafted, with the Ehcache maintainer as Co Spec Lead. This package will continue to
change until JSR107 is finalised. No attempt will be made to maintain backward compatibility between versions
of the package. 

Information on the Ehcache implementation of JSR107, JCACHE, is available on [github](https://github.com/jsr107/ehcache-jcache).

You can also find out more about the JSR effort on [github](https://github.com/jsr107/jsr107spec).
