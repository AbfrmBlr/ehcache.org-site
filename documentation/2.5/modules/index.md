## Modules Table of Contents

| Topic | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
|[SOAP and RESTful Cache Server](/documentation/2.5/modules/cache-server)|The Ehcache Cache Server has two APIs: RESTful resource oriented, and SOAP. The Ehcache RESTFul Web Services API exposes the singleton CacheManager. Resources are identified using a URI template. Ehcache's W3C Web Services support the  WS-I definition and use the SOAP and WSDL specifications.|
|[Web Caching](/documentation/2.5/modules/web-caching)|Ehcache provides a set of general purpose web caching filters in the ehcache-web module. Using these can make a significant difference to web application performance. With built-in gzipping, storage and network transmission are highly efficient. Cache pages and fragments make excellent candidates for DiskStore storage.|
