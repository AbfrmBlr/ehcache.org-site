# Introduction

Distributed Ehcache combines the power of the Terracotta platform with the ease of Ehcache application-data caching. By integrating Enterprise Ehcache with the Terracotta platform, you can:

* linearly scale your application to grow with requirements;
* rely on data that remains consistent across the cluster;
* offload databases to reduce the associated overhead;
* increase application performance with distributed in-memory data.

The distributed-cache documentation covers how to configure Ehcache in a Terracotta cluster and how to use its API in your application.
