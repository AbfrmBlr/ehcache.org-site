### Instructions for building/previewing

* Install Jekyll if you have not - follow instructions on the Jekyll home page (after first installing Ruby)
[http://jekyllrb.com/](http://jekyllrb.com/)

* After installing jekyll, install some gems:
  * nokogiri : "gem install nokogiri"
  * asciidoctor: " gem install jasciidoctor"
  * jekyll-asciidoc: " gem install jekyll-asciidoc"

* Clone this repository to your local system (if you're going to contribute content, fork it first, and clone that)
* cd into the "ehcache.github.io" directory
* "git checkout ehcache.org" to switch to this branch
* "jekyll serve -w"   ( then point your browser at http://localhost:4000" )

### TODOS:

* "About" -> "Features" page:
  * could still use some love, but isn't so bad anymore

* "Downloads" page:
  * validate links are to what we want .

* Documentation 
  * was pulled in from existing ehcache.org site - some links in older docs are broken due to bad (incomplete) URLs.  root page needs better layout, links to both 2.x and 3.x
  * ehcache 3.0 docs need put in  (james working on this)
