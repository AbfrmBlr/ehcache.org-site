### Instructions for building/previewing

* Install Jekyll if you have not - follow instructions on the Jekyll home page (after first installing Ruby)
[http://jekyllrb.com/](http://jekyllrb.com/)

* After installing jekyll, install nokogiri : "gem install nokogiri"


* Clone this repository to your local system (if you're going to contribute content, fork it first, and clone that)
* cd into the "ehcache.github.io" directory
* "git checkout ehcache.org" to switch to this branch
* "jekyll serve -w"   ( then point your browser at http://localhost:4000" )

### TODOS:

* "Features" page could still use some love, but isn't so bad anymore

* "Downloads" page needs better organization, validate links are to what we want .  distinction between 2.x and 3.x things needs to be clear

* Documentation 
  * was pulled in from existing ehcache.org site - some links in older docs are broken due to bad (incomplete) URLs.  root page needs better layout, links to both 2.x and 3.x
  * ehcache 3.0 docs need put in

* Community section stuff needs put in


* Home page needs  ehcache 2.x quick start content

* Footer - haven't really done anything about it yet
