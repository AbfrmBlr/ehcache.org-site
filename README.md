### TODOS:

* "Features" page is really bad, outdated

* "Downloads" page needs better organization, validate links are to what we want .  distinction between 2.x and 3.x things needs to be clear

* Documentation - needs pulled in from existing site(s).  root page needs better layout, links to both 2.x and 3.x

* Community section stuff needs put in

* Events section

* News section

* Home page needs  ehcache 2.x quick start content

* Footer - haven't really done anything about it yet
