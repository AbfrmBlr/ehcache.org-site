### TODOS:

* "Features" page could still use some love, but isn't so bad anymore

* "Downloads" page needs better organization, validate links are to what we want .  distinction between 2.x and 3.x things needs to be clear

* Documentation - was pulled in from existing site - some links in older docs are broken due to bad (incomplete) URLs.  root page needs better layout, links to both 2.x and 3.x

* Community section stuff needs put in


* Home page needs  ehcache 2.x quick start content

* Footer - haven't really done anything about it yet
