Ehcache is maintained by [Terracotta, Inc](http://terracotta.org), a Software AG company.
Terracotta engineers lead the development of Ehcache, which is made available as both an
open source project and the commercial [Enterprise Ehcache](http://terracotta.org/products/enterprise-ehcache) product.

Enterprise Ehcache users get the best of both worlds: enterprise-class features and
support, all based on the popular open source project. Users of open source Ehcache can
easily upgrade to Enterprise Ehcache.
